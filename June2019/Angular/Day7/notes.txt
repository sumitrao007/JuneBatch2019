Routing Steps
1 Configure the routes
2 Add a router outlet
3 Add links/navigate

1 Confugure Routes
 - In App.module->imports section - define RouterModule.forRoot()
  forRoot is static method defined in RouterModule & it is use to define root route for application
2 add router-outlet tag in app.component.html or from where you want to start navigate you can place it
3 Add links
<a href="/Page1">page1 here we can not use this <a href> tag bcz 
   - when use a-tag its page filker
   - every time we click on tag it download all resoursce on each click
     yhis will not be happen bcz we developed a modern angular app (i.e. spa) it loads at the first time so instead of <a href> tag we use
the directive called routerlink,this directive is defined in RouterModule
